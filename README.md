# graphql-federation-demo

This is a simple demo application trying out graphql federation. 
It uses Apollo Gateway to combine the schemas from the movie-app with
the once from the review app so you get on schema to query from.

The movie-app and review-app is build in java with netflix Dgs framework 
for graphql and spring boot.
